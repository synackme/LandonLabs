****** 20 Linux System Monitoring Tools Every SysAdmin Should Know ******
by NIX_Craft on June 27, 2009 · 341_comments· LAST UPDATED January 1, 2014
in CentOS, Debian_Linux, fedora_linux
Need to monitor Linux server performance? Try these built-in commands and a few
add-on tools. Most Linux distributions are equipped with tons of monitoring.
These tools provide metrics which can be used to get information about system
activities. You can use these tools to find the possible causes of a
performance problem. The commands discussed below are some of the most basic
commands when it comes to system analysis and debugging server issues such as:
   1. Finding out bottlenecks.
   2. Disk (storage) bottlenecks.
   3. CPU and memory bottlenecks.
   4. Network bottlenecks.

***** #1: top - Process Activity Command *****
The top program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system i.e.
actual process activity. By default, it displays the most CPU-intensive tasks
running on the server and updates the list every five seconds.
[Fig.01:_Linux_top_command]
Fig.01: Linux top command
**** Commonly Used Hot Keys ****
The top command provides several useful hot keys:
Hot Key Usage
t       Displays summary information off and on.
m       Displays memory information off and on.
A       Sorts the display by top consumers of various system resources. Useful
        for quick identification of performance-hungry tasks on a system.
f       Enters an interactive configuration screen for top. Helpful for setting
        up top for a specific task.
o       Enables you to interactively select the ordering within top.
r       Issues renice command.
k       Issues kill command.
z       Turn on or off color/mono

***** #2: vmstat - System Activity, Hardware and System Information *****
The command vmstat reports information about processes, memory, paging, block
IO, traps, and cpu activity.
# vmstat 3
Sample Outputs:

***** #3: w - Find Out Who Is Logged on And What They Are Doing *****
w command displays information about the users currently on the machine, and
their processes.
# w username
# w vivek
Sample Outputs:
 17:58:47 up 5 days, 20:28,  2 users,  load average: 0.36, 0.26, 0.24
USER     TTY      FROM              LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
root     pts/0    10.1.3.145       14:55    5.00s  0.04s  0.02s vim /etc/
resolv.conf
root     pts/1    10.1.3.145       17:43    0.00s  0.03s  0.00s w
**** #4: uptime - Tell How Long The System Has Been Running ****
The uptime command can be used to see how long the server has been running. The
current time, how long the system has been running, how many users are
currently logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15
minutes.
# uptime
Output:
 18:02:41 up 41 days, 23:42,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
1 can be considered as optimal load value. The load can change from system to
system. For a single CPU system 1 - 3 and SMP systems 6-10 load value might be
acceptable.
***** #5: ps - Displays The Processes *****
ps command will report a snapshot of the current processes. To select all
processes use the -A or -e option:
# ps -A

The tcpdump is simple command that dump traffic on a network. However, you need
good understanding of TCP/IP protocol to utilize this tool. For.e.g to display
traffic info about DNS, enter:
# tcpdump -i eth1 'udp port 53'
To display all IPv4 HTTP packets to and from port 80, i.e. print only packets
that contain data, not, for example, SYN and FIN packets and ACK-only packets,
enter:
# tcpdump 'tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&amp;0xf)<<2)) - ((tcp
[12]&amp;0xf0)>>2)) != 0)'
To display all FTP session to 202.54.1.5, enter:
# tcpdump -i eth1 'dst 202.54.1.5 and (port 21 or 20'
To display all HTTP session to 192.168.1.5:
# tcpdump -ni eth0 'dst 192.168.1.5 and tcp and port http'
Use wireshark_to_view_detailed information about files, enter:
# tcpdump -n -i eth1 -s 0 -w output.txt src or dst port 80

information it displays. A sensor can return simple values or more complex
information like tables. For each type of information, one or more displays are
provided. Displays are organized in worksheets that can be saved and loaded
independently from each other. So, KSysguard is not only a simple task manager
but also a very powerful tool to control large server farms.

***** #20: Gnome System Monitor - Real-time Systems Reporting and Graphing
*****
The System Monitor application enables you to display basic system information
and monitor system processes, usage of system resources, and file systems. You
can also use System Monitor to modify the behavior of your system. Although not
as powerful as the KDE System Guard, it provides the basic information which
may be useful for new users:
    * Displays various basic information about the computer's hardware and
      software.
    * Linux Kernel version
    * GNOME version
    * Hardware
    * Installed memory
    * Processors and speeds
    * System Status
    * Currently available disk space
    * Processes
    * Memory and swap space
    * Network usage
    * File Systems
    * Lists all mounted filesystems along with basic information about each.

***** Bonus: Additional Tools *****
A few more tools:
    * nmap - scan your server for open ports.
    * lsof - list open files, network connections and much more.
    * ntop web based tool - ntop is the best tool to see network usage in a way
      similar to what top command does for processes i.e. it is network traffic
      monitoring software. You can see network status, protocol wise
      distribution of traffic for UDP, TCP, DNS, HTTP and other protocols.
    * Conky - Another good monitoring tool for the X Window System. It is
      highly configurable and is able to monitor many system variables
      including the status of the CPU, memory, swap space, disk storage,
      temperatures, processes, network interfaces, battery power, system
      messages, e-mail inboxes etc.
    * GKrellM - It can be used to monitor the status of CPUs, main memory, hard
      disks, network interfaces, local and remote mailboxes, and many other
      things.
    * vnstat - vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor. It keeps a
      log of hourly, daily and monthly network traffic for the selected
      interface(s).
    * htop - htop is an enhanced version of top, the interactive process
      viewer, which can display the list of processes in a tree form.
    * mtr - mtr combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping programs
      in a single network diagnostic tool.

            Yea, right!
            I’ve been around the block two or three times – and a number of

            were not. Also a fair number of these were absolutely brand-new –
            and they look damned useful!

            For someone with the common knowledge, why would this be handy? I
            mean, if you already know/use these, then why would you need a page
            detailing them?

      Nice list. For systems with just a few nodes I recommend Munin. It’s easy
      to install and configure. My favorite tool for monitoring a linux cluster
      is Ganglia.
      P.S. I think you should change this “#2: vmstat – Network traffic
      statistics by TCP connection …”

                        Most of the time that happens if the fsck operation
                        requires human interaction, which the boot fsck doesn’t
                        have. Just restart it, if you don’t normally get a grub
                        delay the hold down the shift key to get one, if you do
                        then just select recovery mode, or single user mode, it
                        depends on your distro. It’s the same thing in all,
                        just tripping single user mode with a kernel arg, but
                        it will let you boot, and run fsck on unmounted
                        partitions. If it is your root partition, you may need
                        to boot from an external medium, unless you have a kick

      I can see that the best tool to monitor processes , CPU, memeory and disk
      bottleneck at once is atop …
      But the tool itself can cause a lot of trouble in heavily loaded servers
      and it enables process accounting and has a service running all the time
      …
      To use it efficiently on RHEL , CentOS;
      1- install rpmforge repo
      2- # yum install atop
      3- # killalll atop
      4- # chkconfig atop off
      5- # rm -rf /tmp/atop.d/ /var/log/atop/
      6- then don’t directly run “atop” command , but instead run it as
      follows;
      # ATOPACCT=” atop
      This tool has saved me hundreds of hours really! and helped me to
      diagnose bottlenecks and solve them that couldn’t otherwise be easily
      detected and would need many different tools

      good list – and some great submitted pointers to other useful tools.
      to those carp-ing on about typo’s – give us all a break. you’ve never
      made a typo? ever?
      Idea: How ’bout those who have never *ever* made an error in typing text
      be the first one(s) to give people grief about making a typo?
      I _used_ to be a real PITA about this; then I grew up.
      The purpose of this blog, and other forms of communication, is to
      *communicate* concepts and ideas. *If* you have received those clearly –
      in spite of the typos – then the purpose has been fulfilled.

      One tool which seems to be missing from this list is LTTng. It is a
      system-wide tracing tool which helps understanding complex performance
      problems in multithreaded, multiprocess applications involving many
      userspace-kernel interactions.
      The project is available at http://www.lttng.org. Recent SuSE
      distributions, WindRiver, Monta Vista and STLinux offer the tracer as
      distribution packages. The standard way to use it is to install a patched
      kernel though. It comes with a trace analyzer, LTTV, which provides nice
      view of the overall system behavior.

      Nice summary article.
      If your “system” is large and/or distributed, and the performance issues
      you’re tackling are complex, you may wish to explore Performance Co-Pilot
      (PCP). It unifies all of the performance data from the tools you’ve
      mentioned (and more), can be extended to include new applications and
      service layers, works across the network and for clusters and provides
      both real-time and retrospective analysis.
      See http://www.oss.sgi.com/projects/pcp
      PCP is included in the Debian-based and SUSE distributions and is likely
      to appear in the RH distributions in the future.
      As a bonus, PCP also works for monitoring non-Linux platforms (Windows
      and some of the Unix derivatives).

      When I wrote collectl my goal was to replace as many utilities as
      possible for several reasons including:
      - not all write to log files
      - different output formats make correlation VERY difficult
      - sar is close but still too many things it doesn’t collect
      - I wanted option to generate data that can be easily plotted or loaded
      into spreadsheet
      - I wanted sub-second monitoring
      - I want an API and I want to be able to send data over sockets to other
      tools
      - and a whole lot more
      I think I succeeded on many fronts, in particular not having to worry if
      the right data is being collected. Just install rpm and type “/etc/
      init.d/collectl start” and you’re collecting everything such as slabs and
      processes every 60 seconds and everything else every 10 seconds AND using
      <0.1% of the CPU to do so. I personally believe if you're collecting
      performance counters at a minute or coarser you're not really seeing what
      your system is doing.
      As for the API, I worked with some folks at PNNL to monitor their 2300
      node cluster, pass the data to ganglia and from there they pass it to
      their own real-time plotting tool that can display counters for the
      entire cluster in 3D. They also collectl counters from individual CPUs
      and pass that data to collectl as well.
      I put together a very simple mapping of 'standard' utilities like sar to
      the equivilent collectl commands just to get a feel for how they compare.
      But also keep in mind there are a lot of things collectl does for which
      there is no equivalent system command, such as Infiniband or Lustre
      monitoring. How about buddyinfo? And more…

      This is indeed an impressive collection of tools but I still have to ask
      if people are really happy with having to know so many names, so many
      switches and so many formats. If you run one command and see something
      weird doesn’t it bother you if you have to run a different tool but the
      anomaly already passed and you can no longer see it with a different
      tool? For example if you see a drop in network performance and wonder if
      there was a memory or cpu problem, it’s too late to go back and see what
      else was going on. I know it bothers me. Again, by running collectl I
      never have to worry about that because it collects everything (when run
      as a deamon) or you can just tell it to report lots of things when
      running interactively and by default is shows cpu, disk and network. If
      you want to add memory, you can always include it but you will need a
      wider screen to see the output.
      As a curiosity for those who run sar – I never do – what do you use for a
      monitoring interval? The default is to take 10 minute samples which I
      find quite worthless – remember sar has been around forever dating back
      to when cpus were much slower and monitoring much more expensive. I’d
      recommend to run sar with a 10 second sampling level like collectl and
      you’ll get far more out of it. The number of situations which this would
      be too much of a load on your system would be extremely rare. Anyone care
      to comment?

      hi Mark
      absolutely agreed with you mate! if you are the sysadmin something – you
      will do it for yourself and do it right!
      These tools like ps,top and other is commonly used by users who
      administrated a non-productive or desktop systems or for some users who’s
      temporary came to the system and who needed to get a little bit of
      information about the box – and its pretty good enough for them. )

      If you are running a web server and you have multiple clients writing
      code, you will one day see CPU slow to a crawl. “Why?”, you will ask. ps
      -ef and top will show that mysql is eating up resources…
      HMM?
      If only there was a tool which showed me what command was being issued
      against the database…
      mytop
      Once you find the select statement that has mysql running at 99% of the
      CPU, you can kill the query and then go chase down the client and kill
      them too (or in my case bill them at $250/hr for fixing their code).

  117 Mark Seger January 12, 2010 at 6:36 pm
      re mysql – it’s not necessarily that straight forward. I was working with
      someone who had a system with mysql that was crawling. it was taking
      multiple seconds for vi to echo a single character! we ran collectl on it
      and could see low cpu, low network and low disk i/o. Lots of available
      memory, so what gives? A close look showed me that even those the I/
      O rates were low, the average request sizes were also real low – probably
      do so small db requests.
      digging even deeper with collectl I saw the i/o request service times
      were multiple seconds! in other words when you requested an I/O operation
      not matter how fast the disk is, it took over 2 second to complete and
      that’s why vi was so slow, it was trying to write to it’s backing store.
      bottom line – running a single tool and only looking at one thing does
      not tell the whole story. you need to see multiple things AND see them at
      the same time.

      User limits – limit the use of system-wide resources.
      Syntax
      ulimit [-acdfHlmnpsStuv] [limit]
      Options
      -S Change and report the soft limit associated with a resource.
      -H Change and report the hard limit associated with a resource.
      -a All current limits are reported.
      -c The maximum size of core files created.
      -d The maximum size of a process’s data segment.
      -f The maximum size of files created by the shell(default option)
      -l The maximum size that may be locked into memory.
      -m The maximum resident set size.
      -n The maximum number of open file descriptors.
      -p The pipe buffer size.
      -s The maximum stack size.
      -t The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds.
      -u The maximum number of processes available to a single user.
      -v The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the process.
      ulimit provides control over the resources available to the shell and to
      processes started by it, on systems that allow such control.

      but how to kill process ID in my server..
      Reply
        143 FHJ May 11, 2010 at 2:32 pm
            I assume you can find the process ID – for example if your process
            is called foo.bar, you could do
            ps -ef | grep foo.bar
            this will give the PID (process ID) as well as other information.
            Then do
            kill -9 PID (where PID is the number your found in the above).
            If you are working on a Mac you have to do ‘sudo kill -9 PID’ since
            the kill command is an “admin” action that it wants you to be sure
            about.
            Or if you use top, and you can see the process you want to kill in
            your list, you can just type k and you will be prompted for the PID
            (the screen will freeze so it’s easy to read). You type the number
            and “enter”, will have to confirm (y), and the process is killed
            with -15. Which is less “severe” than a “kill -9″ which really
            kills just about any process (without allowing it a graceful exit
            of any kind).
            Use with care!

      atop
      man atop shows
      “The program atop is an interactive monitor to view the load on a Linux
      system. It shows the occupation of the most critical hardware resources
      (from a performance point of view) on system level, i.e. cpu, memory,
      disk and network.It also shows which processes are responsible for the
      indicated load with respect to cpu- and memory load on process level;
      disk- and network load is only shown per process if a kernel patch has
      been installed.”

      fuser command is missing from this list. it tells you which command is
      using a file at the moment. Since in Linux everything is a file, it is
      very useful to know!
      Use it this way:
      # to know which process listens on tcp port 80:
      fuser 80/tcp
      # to know which process uses the /dev/sdb1 filesystem:
      fuser -vm /dev/sdb1

      I don’t believe that ftp usage by user is recorded anywhere, so you’d
      have to get inventive. The way I would do it is use collectl to show both
      processes sorted by I/O and ftp stats. Then is simply becomes a matter of
      see which processes are contributing to the I/O and who their owners are.

      Don’t forget systemtap (stap) which provides the equivalent of Solaris’
      invaluable “dtrace” scripting utility. There’s a “dtrace” for Linux
      project but I haven’t been able to get it to compile on my OpenSuSE 11.x.
      On SuSE Linux is “getdelays” , enabled via the grub kernel command line
      “delayacct” switch (starting with SuSE 10 Enterprise…). It’ll reveal the
      amount of wait a given process spends waiting for CPU, disk (I/O) or
      memory (swap), great for isolating lag in the system.
      There are many many other monitoring tools (don’t know if these were
      mentioned before) atopsar (atop-related), the sysstat/sar-related sa*
      series (sadc, sadf, sa1), isag, saidar, blktrace (blktrace-blkiomon /
      blktrace-blkparse), iotop, ftop, htop, nigel’s monitor (nmon), famd/
      fileschanged, acctail, sysctl, dstat, iftop, btrace, ftop, iostat,
      iptraf, jnettop, collectl, nagios, the RRD-related tools, the sys-fs

      If you want to monitor CPU, memory, I/O and disk usage across multiple
      servers you can use Librato Silverline – it’s a commercial product but
      the first 8 cores are always free. You can actually do a lot more with
      Silverline, i.e. place apps in individual containers, assign resource
      quotas to containers, trigger events etc. but as a monitoring tool it is
      really great too.

      Great list, but why is TOP still used?
      It is a highly limited utility. HTOP can do all top can, plus a ton of
      stuff more:
      1. use colors for better readabilty. In the 21st century, all computers
      have a super hightech thing on their monitor called COLORS (sarcasm off)
      2. allow process termination and sending of signals (even multi select
      several processes)
      3. show cpu / ram usage with visual bars instead of numbers
      4. show ALL processes: top cannot do that, it just shows what is on the
      screen. It is the main limiting factor that made me chuck it to the curb.
      5. Use your cursor keys to explore what cannot be shown on the screen,
      for example full CLI parameters from commands.
      6. Active development. There are new features. Top is dead and there does
      not seem to have been any active development for 10 years (and that is
      how the tool looks)

      “My Oracle Enterprice Linux getting very slow, when my local R12.1
      start.”
      Arghh! Linux is turning into Windows!
      These are super machines, people! Remember when 4.2BSD came out, and
      people were saying “Unix is becoming VMS”? With 4.1 BSD, we had been
      flying on one MIP machines (think of a one Mhz clock rate – three orders
      of magnitude slower than today’s machines, not Ghz… Mhz!). So much was
      added so quickly into 4.2 (kernels were no longer a few hundred kilobytes
      at most) that performance took a nose dive. But then 4.3 BSD fixed things
      for a while (with lots of optimizations such as unrolling the the
      instructions in a bcopy loop till they just just filled an instruction
      cache line). It didn’t hurt either that memory was getting cheaper, and
      we could afford to upgrade our 30 user timesharing systems from four
      Megabytes to eight Megabytes, or even more! It takes an awful amount of
      software bloat (and blind ignorance of the principles we all learned in
      our “combinatorial algorithms” classes) to be able to make machines that
      are over a thousand times faster than the Vaxen we cut our teeth on be
      “slow”.
      Today’s Linux systems hardly feel much faster on multicore x86 machines
      than they did on personal MicroVaxes or the somewhat faster Motorola
      68020 based workstations (except for compilations, which now really
      scream by – compiling a quarter meg kernel used to take hours, whereas
      now it feels like barely seconds pass when compiling kernels that, even
      compressed, are many times larger. But then, compiler writers for the
      most part (25 years ago, Green Hills employees seemed a glaring exception
      and I don’t know about Microsoft) have to prove they have learned good
      programming practices before their skills are considered acceptable).
      Other software, like the X server, still feels about the same as it did
      in the eighties, despite today’s machines being so much faster. And
      forget about Windows!

      files are opened by CACHE out of the total numbers found above?? what are
      the files used by CACHE? Whats the virtual memory used by the process.
      What is the current run level of the process.
      Part3: How many users or terminals are accessing the process CACHE?
      Part4: The script should run every 15secs with the time of execution
      &amp; date of script and the output should be given to a file
      “richprocess” in the same order as that of the question.
      Note: NO EXTERNAL TOOLS are allowed to be used with linux. Only shell
      script should be written for the same!

            you can try strace as mentioned in the tools and you can also look

      diff region/areas.I want to monitor the Wifi routers sitting in one
      place.
      I have connected Debian installed thin client to each router to provide
      internet to the customers @ cafe,free browsing for 30 mins.
      Can some one suggest me a tool for monitoring the Routers &amp; my debian

            Such routers often include a management/monitoring package, which
            may be more immediately useful than using Debian-based commands,
            and the router software may allow for viewing the multiple routers
            you describe from a single screen. I know that the latest NETGEAR
            wireless routers include a software package like this.
            But, why just 30 minutes per customer? Isn’t that the wrong message
            to give the cafe customers?: Like, hurry up and drink your coffee/
            tea, and then get out!!
            Maybe you could try a one hour limit and see what happens. Linux is
            much more efficient than many people realize, even under heavy
            usage.
            I think that Starbucks and similar shops in North America tend to
            offer unlimited Internet access with any purchase – and most don’t
            really seem to enforce the purchase requirement, unless a
            “freeloader” is annoying or being offensive to other customers,
            etc.

      My new favourite tool is “systemd.analyze”. It is great for pin-pointing
      bottle-necks in startup. It can produce a very nice plot of every
      process, allowing you instantly see what’s holding things up.

      Instead of Cacti I prefer munin. Installation and configuration is easy
      and on monitored systems, only a small client is needed.

      I would replace top with htop, it extents top with a much nicer ncurses
      and lots of functions …

      And I am using “watch” utility. This is basically not a system monitoring
      tool. But in some case we need to watch the out put of a command
      continuously. That time this is not easy to enter the same command all
      the time and watch the output. In that case you can use this utility. You
      can set the interval of each refresh.
      Eg: watch -n 10 df -Th (this is just an example)
      This command will give you the output of df -Th in each 10 seconds. Then
      you can easily measure the hard disk usage.
      Cheers…!

      I’d also add ‘monit’ utility, to monitor assorted services and perform
      actions 9such as restarting the stopped service).

      TQ, Very helpful tips… Just my $0.02; ETHERAPE for linux is a free
      graphical tool http://etherape.sourceforge.net/ which is really helpful
      to help monitor network traffic in a network segment. Many instances i
      managed to pinpoint which PC/server is heavily broadcasting packets that
      caused network slow-down.. tq

      Thx for that usefull info:
      Even if we use or not some web host managers, know manual usage of some
      tools is a must have for a sysadmin, or almost for decent ones… What will
      you do when the host manager dont work? Who have to repair it? Is You and
      you will need a real knowledge about what’s on your hands :)
      So many thanks again.

      The ps syntax is wrong.
      For memory:
      ps aux |sort -nrk 4 |head -10
      For cpu:
      ps aux |sort -nrk 3 |head -10
